Citizenship Governance is a one-stop smart government portal to promote a smart city driven by the citizens of the government. The citizens will be allowed to rate the government on several KPIs such as education, economical prosperity, ICT, water and sanitation, employment, etc. 
Accordingly, this will develop a rating index for the government which will be public information.
Serves 2 purposes:    
1. Firstly, it lets the citizens express their opinions on a public forum, ensuring increased transparency and more priority on performance from the government. 
2. The ruling government and those trying to get into power can use this information to focus on real pressing issues to satisfy the needs of the government.
